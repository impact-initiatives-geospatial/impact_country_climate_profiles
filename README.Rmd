# impact_country_climate_profiles

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->


This repo will be used to develop and store code for the impact country profiles. 

I think a markdown document per country of interest could be a nice intermediary product. R, Python, and Javascript tools/functions can be referenced in these markdown documents
